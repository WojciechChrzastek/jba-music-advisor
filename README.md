## About the project

The project is designed by [JetBrains Academy](https://www.jetbrains.com/academy/) and realised as a part of [Java Developer track](https://hyperskill.org/onboarding) using [EduTools](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10081-edutools) plugin for [IDEA InteliJ IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

The aim is to create application serving as a personal music advisor that makes preference-based suggestions and shares links to new releases and featured playlists. The program will communicate with with the [API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) of a popular [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/pl/) music streaming service.

[Detailed description](https://hyperskill.org/projects/62) of the project is available on JetBrains Academy website.

### Realisation of the project is divided into 5 stages:
- Stage #1. Enabling the program to search for relevant songs among manually entered items.
- Stage #2. Developing the application by building it using Gradle and connecting with Spotify by OAuth.
- Stage #3. Implementing anonymous classes and making the connection with Spotify reciprocal.
- Stage #4. Working with Java generics and dependencies, implementing REST architecture.
- Stage #5. Applying design patterns to improve the code and make the userâ€™s experience better.
